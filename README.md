# Wasteless site

this site has been the original working prototype of the very first customer-facing Wasteless website.

It was conceived as a marketing tool to present to prospects and later on served as a gateway to log into the web interface.

It has been written using Gatsby in order to reduce hosting costs, all server-like functionality is served using AWS lambdas.

In order for the marketing department to edit the content to their liking, the site's models are connected to a headless CMS.
