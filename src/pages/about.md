We are scouts for circular economy innovations and trends in all industry segments. We look at hundreds of circular innovations every day. We know who does what, where and how.

We are upcycling-geeks ourselves and therefore know what works for consumers and what doesn't. Our CEO goes to pitches dressed in former waste. We are the real deal.

We are also business people. We get things done. We do the necessary and leave out the rest. We take a deep-dive into possible business cases and condense them into a portfolio of concrete opportunities that can be acted and decided upon.

We are also on fire for industrial production. We want scalable solutions. We calculate business cases for new supply chains, production sites and consumer products. We discuss positioning over lunch and factory layouts over coffee.

We are productive. We want to create impact. We care so much about bringing innovations to life that we already start working on the implementation while we establish the business case for a project, to speed up the process.

We are structured. We are strategic. We are agile. We take a straightforward approach to innovation. We are not afraid to fail and therefore able to succeed. We do not unnecessarily cling to things we started. There is so much to do.
