      Responsible consumption is of high significance for today’s society.
      Decoupling value creation from resource consumption is a missing step on
      the stairway to sustainability. The added value associated with taking
      this step – if communicated accurately – enables innovators to easily
      outperform their non-circular competition.


      The value of production side-streams is often underestimated. The right
      downstream applications of your material create additional revenues and
      diversified value creation for your company. Additionally, they generate
      additional value for your customers and reduce the ecological footprint of
      your production.
